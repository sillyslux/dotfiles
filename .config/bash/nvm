#!/bin/bash

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

# that approach has caveats, including that node and npm and globally installed modules in the default version all arenâ€™t available right away... but it saves me some time when opening a new shell `time bash -c "./nvm"   real    0m0.825s`
loadnvm() {
  unset -f npm npx node
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
  $@
}

# i think this was speeding up initialization of new terminals
